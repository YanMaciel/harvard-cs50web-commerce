# Academic Honesty
If you are taking Harvard's CS50 Web Programming with Python and JavaScript course you **must follow the course's [Academic Honesty philosophy](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/honesty/)**.

It is not reasonable to access a solution to some assessment prior to (re-)submitting your own.

The essence of all work that you submit to the CS50 course **must be your own**.
